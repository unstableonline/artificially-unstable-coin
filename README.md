# artificially-unstable-coin
A bot that controls the dev wallet and the dev creator rewards to buy and sell on the chart, creating an artificially unstable chart. The bot uses fees from rewards and does not hold much supply meaning it cannot be farmed and cannot "rug" the token. More so outplay the narrative of being artificial.
